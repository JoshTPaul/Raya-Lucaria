        Those who dedicate themselves to the study of glintstones formed from
        starry amber receive this modest yet elegant deep blue garb along with
        their vows of virtue and austerity.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those enrolled in a particular conspectus, the stone crown provided
        by the conspectus magistrate is also a required part of the academy
        uniform.
      </p>
      <p>
        The academy also provides foundational scrolls and the academyâ€™s own
        Glintstone staff to all new sorcerers to aid in the study and research
        of Glintstone, be it under the guidance of a conspectus or on thine own
        accord.
