        Our powers draw upon the powers embedded in glintstone, but what is the
        nature of such power? Glintstone is the amber of the cosmos, golden
        amber contains the remnants of ancient life and houses its vitality,
        while Glintstone contains residual life. And thus, the vitality of the
        stars. It should not be forgotten that glintstone sorcery is the study
        of the stars and the life therein.

        The power of the cosmic void is one that stands at the pinnacle of
        sorcery, and very few have attained its knowledge; and even fewer are
        able to grasp and manifest its true power. With the boundless knowledge
        procured over the time since the inception of the academy, you may find
        no other substitute for an education in sorcery in all the Lands
        Between.
